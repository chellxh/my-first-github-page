          Why live rough? The key to success is to keep your head above the
          water, never give up. Watch your back, but more importantly when you

          The key to more success is to have a lot of pillows. Always remember
          in the jungle there's a lot of they in there, after you overcome they,

          water. Of course they don't want us to eat our breakfast, so we are
          going to enjoy our breakfast. Watch your back, but more importantly
          when you get out the shower, dry your back, it's a cold world out
          there. To succeed you must believe. When you believe, you will
          succeed.
